# This script is inspired by the work published by https://github.com/austincunningham
# at https://dev.to/austincunningham/enforcing-git-commit-message-style-4gah
# 
# This script is meant to be included in the CI to verify that 
# the commits made into master follow the following commit format:
# https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/contribute/git-commit-message.md
# 
# <type>(<subject>): <commit meta text> [TICKET]
#
# <type> can be one of:
#   feat: A new feature
#   fix: A bug fix
#   breaking: A breaking bug fix
#   docs: Documentation only changes
#   style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
#   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   perf: A code change that improves performance
#   test: Adding missing tests
#   chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
#
